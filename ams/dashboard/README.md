This is the Dashboard frontend for Amoro Management Service (AMS).

## Requirements

- node `16.x`
- yarn `1.x` (optional)

## Installing Dependencies

In the `ams/dashboard` directory, run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Running Locally

After completing the [Installing Dependencies](#Installing Dependencies) step, you're ready to start the project!

### Configure the ams Server to connect to

1. open the `vue.config.js` under the folder `ams/dashboard`

2. find the `ENV_HOST` configuration and change the environment corresponding to the `DEV`

```
const ENV_HOST = {
  DEV: 'http://127.0.0.1:1630/', // Change it to the address of your development server
  TEST: '',
  ONLINE: ''
}
```

### Start a development server

In the `ams/dashboard` directory, run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` to start a development server for the dashboard app at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Building Project

In the `ams/dashboard` directory, run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to prepare the dashboard for deployment.

Since we don't currently have a front-end CI configured, we must execute the `yarn build` or `npm run build` command before committing the front-end code each time, and commit the static file changes in the `ams/dashboard/src/mian/resource/static` directory along with it.

In addition, you can run `yarn build:vue-dev` or `npm run build:vue-dev` to create dev build for the dashboard.
